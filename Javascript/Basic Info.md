# Basic Info

JavaScript was developed to allow developers to add life to web pages (interactivity, animations, etc.)

Programs are called 'scripts'

JavaScript can execute on browsers, server's or any device with a JavaScript engine.

The most popular javascript engines are:

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript is the best language in the world";
console.log(s);
```
