# Strict Mode

Throughout the development of JS many things have changed. However, in order to prevent old code from breaking, many of these modifications need to be explicitly enabled.

You can include the following line at the top of your JS code to enter 'strict mode'

```javascript
"use strict";
```

## Always 'use strict'

1. The 'use strict' directive switches the engine to the modern mode, changing the behaviuour of some built-in features.
2. Strict mode is enabled by placing 'use strict' at the top of a script or function. Several features like 'classes' and 'modules', enable strict by default.
3. Strict mode is supported by all modern browsers.
4. Always use it.
