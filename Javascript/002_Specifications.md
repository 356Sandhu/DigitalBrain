## Specification

JavaScript's most in depth specification is ECMA-262, with a new specification being released annually. This isn't a guide that one should use everyday, as it's very formal.

For insight into probable future additions to the language, one should refer to https://github.com/tc39/proposals as it contains stage-3 proposals that will likely become future standards.
