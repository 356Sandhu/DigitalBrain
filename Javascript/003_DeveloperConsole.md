# Developer Console

In the browser, error's aren't shown to the user by default. So, if something goes wrong we won't know it did or how to fix it.

In order to see errors browsers have built in 'developer tools'.

Most developers like to develop on Chrome and Firefox because they have the best developer tools. Developer tool's have many features.

## Chrome

Chrome's developer tools can be accessed by pressing
CMD + Opt + J

The console tab is opened by default and allows you to view the errors and warnings. The console also allows you to enter and run scripts by the line.
